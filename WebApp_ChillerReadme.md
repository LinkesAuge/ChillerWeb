# TB Chest Analyzer - Documentation (Client-Side Static Data Version)

## 1. Overview

**Purpose:**

The TB Chest Analyzer is a single-page web application designed for players and members of the "The Chiller" clan in the game "Total Battle". Its primary goal is to load, process, analyze, and visualize player chest data exported from the game in CSV format. This tool allows users to gain insights into individual and comparative performance based on chest collection metrics.

**Version Type:**

This specific version operates **entirely client-side**. It fetches its primary dataset (`data.csv`) and scoring rules (`rules.csv`) from static files hosted alongside the main `index.html` file. It uses the user's web browser to perform all calculations and rendering. Data persistence across browser sessions relies on the static nature of the hosted CSV files (updated by the website owner) and `localStorage` for user preferences like language selection.

**Target Audience:**

*   Players of "Total Battle", particularly members of "The Chiller" clan.
*   Clan leadership or analysts looking to track member activity and scoring.

## 2. Core Features

*   **Static Data Loading:** Automatically fetches and parses predefined `data.csv` and `rules.csv` files on page load.
*   **Multilingual Interface:**
    *   Defaults to German (`de`).
    *   Provides a simple switcher in the header to toggle between German (`DE`) and English (`EN`).
    *   User's language preference is stored in `localStorage`.
*   **Structured Navigation:** A persistent top navigation bar allows easy access to different views:

    *   **Overall Player Ranking:** A primary table showing all players ranked by Total Score (default). Supports sorting by Rank, Player Name, Total Score, and Chest Count. Includes visual highlighting for the top 3 ranks. Provides text-based filtering by Player Name.
    *   **Visualizations:**
        *   *Top Sources by Score:* Donut chart showing the top 7 chest sources contributing most to the total score across all players (plus an 'Others' category).
        *   *Score Distribution:* Histogram (bar chart) showing the number of players within dynamically calculated score brackets.
        *   *Score vs. Chests:* Scatter plot visualizing the relationship between total chests collected and total score for each player.

*   **Analytics View (`Analytik`):**
    *   **Category Analysis:** Allows selecting a specific chest source category from a dropdown. Displays a table ranking players by score within that category and a bar chart visualizing the score distribution for that category.
    *   **Placeholders:** Includes designated areas for future "Player Analysis" (e.g., comparisons) and "Clan Analysis" (e.g., aggregate trends) features.
*   **Score System View (`Punktesystem`):**
    *   Fetches data from `rules.csv`.
    *   Displays a sortable table showing the scoring rules (Typ/Type, Level, Punkte/Points). Supports sorting by each column.

    *   Presents a Radar chart visualizing the player's top 8 scoring categories.
    *   Provides a button to download the specific player's data (all their columns/scores) as a formatted JSON file.
*   **Data Downloads:**
    *   **Processed CSV:** A button in the header allows downloading the entire processed player dataset (`allPlayersData`) as a CSV file.
    *   **Player JSON:** Download individual player data from the detail view.

## 3. Technology Stack

*   **HTML5:** Provides the structure and semantic markup for the single-page application.
*   **CSS3 / Tailwind CSS (v3 via CDN):** Used for all styling and layout. A utility-first approach allows for rapid development and customization. Base styles and theme colors are defined using CSS variables within a `<style>` block.
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla ES6+):** Handles all client-side logic, including:
    *   Fetching static CSV files (`fetch` API).
    *   Parsing CSV data (using PapaParse library).
    *   Data cleaning and transformation.
    *   State management (tracking current view, language, loaded data, sort states).
    *   DOM manipulation (updating text, showing/hiding sections, building tables).
    *   Event handling (clicks, input changes).
    *   Calculations for aggregate statistics.
    *   Chart rendering (using ApexCharts library).
    *   Internationalization (i18n).
    *   Generating downloads.
*   **PapaParse:** A robust client-side JavaScript CSV parsing library used to convert the fetched CSV text into usable JavaScript objects.
*   **ApexCharts:** A modern JavaScript charting library used to generate interactive and customizable SVG charts (Donut, Bar, Scatter, Radar).
