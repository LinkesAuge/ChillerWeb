# Project Brief: TB Chest Analyzer (Client-Side Static Version)

## 1. Core Purpose

To create a single-page, client-side web application named "TB Chest Analyzer" for the "The Chiller" clan in the game "Total Battle".

## 2. Primary Goal

Load, process, analyze, and visualize player chest data exported from the game. The application will use static `data.csv` and `rules.csv` files hosted alongside the application as its data sources.

## 3. Key Objectives

*   Provide insights into individual and comparative player performance based on chest collection metrics.
*   Offer different views for data exploration: Dashboard, Full Data Table, Charts, Analytics, Score System.
*   Support multilingual interface (German/English).
*   Operate entirely within the user's web browser without a backend server component for data processing.

## 4. Target Audience

*   Players of "Total Battle", specifically members of "The Chiller" clan.
*   Clan leadership for tracking member activity and scoring.

## 5. Scope

This version is limited to client-side processing of predefined static data files. It focuses on data visualization and basic analysis based on the provided CSVs. Future enhancements might include more complex analytics or different data loading mechanisms, but are out of scope for this initial static version.
