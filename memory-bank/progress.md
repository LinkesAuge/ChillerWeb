# Progress: TB Chest Analyzer (Client-Side Static)

## 1. What Works (Based on README)

Assuming `index.html` implements the features described in `WebApp_ChillerReadme.md`:

*   Static data loading (`data.csv`, `rules.csv`).
*   Multilingual interface (DE/EN) with `localStorage` persistence.
*   Navigation between views (Dashboard, Data, Charts, Analytics, Score System).
*   Dashboard view with aggregated stats, overall ranking table (sortable, filterable), and visualizations (Top Sources, Score Distribution, Score vs. Chests, Frequent Sources, Top 5 Chests).
*   Chart modal for larger views.
*   Full Data Table view (sortable, scrollable).
*   Charts view displaying dashboard charts.
*   Analytics view (Category Analysis functional, Player/Clan Analysis placeholders).
*   Score System view displaying sortable rules table.
*   Player Detail view (accessed via click, shows stats, scored sources list, Radar chart, JSON download).
*   Overall processed data CSV download.
*   Chart image downloads (via ApexCharts menu).
*   Dark fantasy theme via Tailwind CSS.

## 2. What's Left to Build

*   Features designated as placeholders in the Analytics view (Player Analysis, Clan Analysis).
*   Any features not yet implemented or bugs not identified in the initial assessment.

## 3. Current Status

*   Project exists as a functional client-side SPA based on the description.
*   Memory bank initialization is complete.

## 4. Known Issues

*   None identified yet. Requires further testing or code review.
*   Potential performance limitations with very large datasets due to client-side processing.
